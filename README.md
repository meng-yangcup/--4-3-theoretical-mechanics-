This is a nonlinear system of equations, solved by Newton's iteration method. The idea should be correct, but the result has a large error with the exact value
As shown in the figure, the rod placed on the V-shaped groove acts on a force couple, and the moment of the couple is M=15Nm, 
which is just enough to rotate the rod. The weight of the bar is P=400N, and the diameter is D=0.25m.
Static friction coefficient between material and V-groove
1、Elimination method
2、Iterative method
3、Uing wolfram alpha

2、Support force 1= x1, support force 2=x2, friction force 1=x3, friction force 4=x4; static friction factor fs=x5, which is the parameter to be found
